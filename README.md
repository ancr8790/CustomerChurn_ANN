Predicting Customer Churn with artificial Neural Networks

[Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubh0799/churn-modelling/data)

The purpose of this project is to utilize Artificial Neural Networks to monitor and predict whether a customer will keep continue to use the company's services or take their business elsewhere. This information would be vital to the company's business planning to help determine where internal resources would be best distributed to and to proactively understand what relationships may need nuturing. The dataset consists of records for 10,000 customers that were previously classified as churned away from the company's services or remained. This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Deep Learning course at the University of Colorado Boulder as the final project.

The data was taken from a Kaggle repository and the model's were evaluated with accuracy and F1-Scores.

The Best Model trained had an accuracy score of 76, an F1-score of 77, and the following hyperparameters: 

* Architecture: Model 2
* Hidden layers: 2
*  Dataset: Balanced
*  Final activation function: Tanh
*  Optimizer: Adam
*  Epochs: 50
*  Regularization: N/A
